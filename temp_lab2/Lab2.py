# Task A2.1: Temperature Logging and Collection (3 points - Mandatory)
# In this task, you should record the temperature data from Arduino Nano RP2040. The frequency of the record is to be at least 1 Hz (1 second). Record the data for at least 15 minutes (900 data rows or more). To make the temperature vary a bit, do several "hot blow"s like "huh"s or "blows" on the board or simply put your finger on the sensor while recording the data. Save them into a CSV. Remember to Submit both CSV and your Python Code.

# Hint: To turn your logging data into CSV file, there are some third-party software online that you can use or IDE script which does that.

# Note: Your CSV file should look something like this:

# Timesteps,Temperature
# 1,28.1
# 2,28.8
# 3,29.0
# ....
# I- Collect the data in a CSV file and submit it with the rest of your results (2pts-Mandatory)

# II- Visualize the data with a line graph with two axes: time & temperature with criteria below (1pt-Mandatory)

# The color of the line should be orange
# Add labels for each axes (Temperature (degrees Celsius), Time(seconds)),
# Turn on the grids 
# Add legend on the top right corner - temperature

def temperature_data_visualization():
    # Read the CSV file
    df = pd.read_csv('lab2/Data/temperature.csv')

    # Plot the data
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
    plt.plot(df['Timesteps'], df['Temperature'], color='orange', label='Temperature')
    plt.xlabel('Time (seconds)')
    plt.ylabel('Temperature (degrees Celsius)')
    plt.title('Temperature over Time')
    plt.grid(True)
    plt.legend(loc='upper right')
    plt.show()

# Task A2.2: Motion Logging - Acc/Gyr  and Collection (5 points - Mandatory)

# In this task, you should record the motion data from Arduino Nano RP2040. The frequency of the record is to be at least 2 Hz (0.5 second). Record the data for at least 10 minutes (1200 rows or more). You should collect both accelerometer and gyroscope data. Wiggle the Arduino slightly and abruptly (!) in different directions and angles (Do both angles and directions!) while collecting the motion, to have some peaks in your data. Save them into a CSV. Do the wiggles in certain intervals so you get something like the figure below. 

# Namnl√∂s.png

# Note: Your CSV file should look something like this:

# Date, Time, Ax, Ay, Az, Gx, Gy, Gz
# 2025-02-01, 10:28:30:00, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0
# 2025-02-01, 10:28:30:05, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0

# 2025-02-01, 10:28:31:00, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0

# 2025-02-01, 10:28:31:05, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0

# 2025-02-01, 10:28:32:00, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0
# ....

# Hint: To record date and time you can use RTC module and library, but for the sake of simplicity, you don't need to use that for this task. You can define the starting date and time on top of your sketch and use the "Delay" command to define the data logging intervals.

# I- Collect the data in a CSV file and submit it with the rest of your results (2pts-Mandatory)

# II- Visualize the data with a line graph with two axes with criteria below (1pt-Mandatory)

# plot 6 axis of data
# Add labels for each axes (Acceleration (m.sq/s.sq), Time(seconds)),
# Turn on the grids 
# Add legend on the top right corner - the name of your plots should be Ax, Ay, Az, Gx, Gy, Gz

def acc_gyro_data_visualization():
    # Read the CSV file
    df = pd.read_csv('lab2/Data/acceleration.csv')
    print(df.info())

    # Plot the data
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
    plt.plot(df['Time'], df['Ax'], color='red', label='Ax')
    plt.plot(df['Time'], df['Ay'], color='green', label='Ay')
    plt.plot(df['Time'], df['Az'], color='blue', label='Az')

    plt.show()


# III- (Manipulate the data) With one of the the functions mentioned in the instruction above, write a code which deletes rows of data from your dataset that the acceleration is 0 or close to 0. This will compress your signals to look something like the right graphs below in Fig. 9. Visualize the data again with the above criteria in a line graph. Pay attention that you need to look at the data and define the threshold accordingly for deleting stationary data. The threshold might be different for different axes  (2pt-Mandatory)
